# PetConnect
PetConnect is a multilingual platform that connects animal shelters and private individuals to facilitate pet adoption worldwide. Additionally, if time allows, the platform will include a pet-sitting feature to help pet owners find trusted sitters.

> **Due to security considerations, the `.env` file is not included in this repository. Please contact a developer to obtain the necessary credentials. A more secure and scalable solution is in development.**

> ⚠️ **Note:** The backend currently needs to be started manually using `node app.js`. This is only a temporary setup and will be replaced in future updates.
